# MigrateDocumentation

This is a one-off quicke to fix documentation issues after migrating TextEdit from CodePlex.

* Renames files to be adressable by MD (and prettifies them as well)
* Updates internal links

Running this a second time should be a noop, so long as no new features are added. There are still things that need to be fixed and that could benefit from automation.
